# Graphics Project
This is an undergraduate course project.
We try to make a graphics system to generate different 3-D objects and draw textures on it.
Our method of using triangle stitching not only generated objects with flat surfaces, but also some objects containing curved surfaces.
Finally, we use our objects and loading features to generate a map of desert maze, and we create a camera as the first-person perspective. We design a maze game.
